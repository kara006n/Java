package polymorphism;

public class A {
	//it means one name many form....rest defination we know....actually it is a feature in java in which with one name we can do 
	//different things....but before explaining in more detail first undestand it that it is only applicable on methods not variables
	//not constructors no class nothing because not possible to apply on these.
	
	//so in methods how it is applies actually is with one name for method we do make it do different things. it is achived using
	//2 methods i.e. overloading and overriding
	
	//we know overloading as we have already seen constructor overloading so is it example of polymorphism yes but that is compile time
	//polymorphism because at compile time only it is decided which constructor will be made to run but here we are talking about
	//runtime polymorphism. so overloading is same in that signature of methods are different like in terms of types and number of 
	//arguments but name is same.. next we will see overriding.
	
	//for overriding to happen we  need to know inheritance because first we will inheirt methods of parent class to child class then
	//we will alter the logic of these mmethods in child class and make them perform some other function. so one will say both are
	///different function in different class how is this polymorphism? if this is polymorphism then if we make 2 methods with same 
	//name but in different class then is that also polymorphism...no the reason is in that case both are different methods as they 
	//belong to different class but there child class is actulally derived from base class only so all the methods of base class are 
	//inherited in child class means a xerox copy of methods are made in child class from base class...to ye methods ko bhi same 
	//perform krna chahiye jaise base class wale methods perform kr rhe hai or say same kaam krna chahiye lekin nhi humne same method
	//ka logic change kr diya hai child class me to ab vahi same methods jo ki base class me kuch kaam kr raha hoga ab child class me 
	//bhi usse same kaam krna chahiye the lekin ab ussi naam se hum usse dusra kaam le rhe hai jbki signature dono methods ka same hai
	//yaha so this is polymorphism aur ye child class base class jude huye hau alag alag nhi hai. to overloading me same class me diff.
	//methods rehte the unka naam same rehta tha bas signature different thi yaha overriding me class same nhi hai ya bolde ki same 
	//hi smjh lo but signature same hai yaha pe. overriding kyu krte hai base class ke methods ka logic change krne ke liye.
	
	
	//now see recordings i will record now.
